                <h2> Speciality Areas. </h2>
                <p> Every patient has differing needs and aspects of their lives they are looking to work through. Here are some of the key areas I specialise in. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4_xs-12 padded">
                <h3> Depression & Anxiety </h3>
                <p> While we all feel sad, irritable or stressed from time to time, some people experience these feelings intensely or for sustained periods without apparent reason. Depression is more than just a mood, and anxiety is more than just feeling worried. I specialise in techniques to help people explore their feelings and take control.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4_xs-12 padded">
                <h3> Self-care & Well-being </h3>
                <p> Modern day life can cause us to invest less time and thought into our own lives and into ourselves. Therapy is not just for those suffering from mental health conditions, and can offer a safe and secure space to explore everyday issues, be more mindful, and to look closer at how to take care of our mental health. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4_xs-12 padded">
                <h3> Trauma & Healing </h3>
                <p> Life experiences can leave inedible marks on us, both as children and as adults. Our past selves shape our present and future selves. Delving into our past, although often painful, can help us work forward and heal from traumatic events that may be impacting our lives. </p>

                <h4> Treatment Duration </h4>
                <p> Therapy sessions 50 minutes and are most beneficial on a weekly basis. The length of time an individual is in therapy depends on multiple factors. There is no set time as each person and concern is unique. This can be discussed with a Therapist during sessions or treatment. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12">
                <h4> Confidentiality </h4>
                <p> Confidentiality and privacy is a respected aspect of a Therapist's ethics. Your privacy is maintained to a professional extent during and after your treatment. In some serious and specific situations, Therapists may need to disclose information to protect the patient, </p>

            <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12">
                <h4> Online Therapy </h4>
                <p> Online therapy is the same practise as in-person, but held over an online platform such as Zoom. This can be a great service for those who are time-poor, living outside the area or those who wish to seek therapy in the comfort of their own home. </p>

            <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12">
                <h4> Fees & Cancellation </h4>
                <p> Fees are paid directly to the Therapist at the end of session by cash only. There are no debit/credit facilities available. The Therapy Centre employs a strick 48 hour cancellation policy. Appointments cancelled after this will be charged in full. </p>
