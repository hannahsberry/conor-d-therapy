                <p> Conor is a qualified Psychotherapist and Counsellor with pre-accredited membership of IACP, working under their ethics and guidelines while continuing his professional development and attending regular supervision to ensure his work is maintained to a high standard. Conor works as part of The Therapy Centre in Mountjoy, helping a range of clients from different backgrounds with differing issues. </p>
                <p> With a genuine interest in providing a collaborative and integreated approach, Conor is furthering his education by starting a MA in Pluralistic Psychotherapy this year. Pluralistic psychotherapy is a collaborative and integrative approach, rooted in humanistic and person-centred values. It's core premise is that each client is unique, and therefore may need different things from therapy. With this in mind, pluralistic psychotherapy seeks to create a framework in which practitioners can integrate a wide variety of schools of thought and methods into their practice. Collaborative decision making is a key element of the pluralistic approach: talking to clients about what they want from therapy, and how they might most effectively be helped to get there. He hopes that by continually developing as a therapist and counsellor he will be able to provide an outstanding level of care to his clients. </p>

            <h2> My Approach </h2>
            <p> Conor believes psychotherapy is a powerful journey of self-discovery. He approaches therapy non-judgmentally and with compassion in order to produce a strong therapeutic relationship that promotes empowerment and change.</p>
            <p> In this warm, empathetic and challenging environment, clients can safely explore themselves and their issues. Conor takes a person-centred, humanistic and integrative approach.

                    <h3> What is psychotherapy? </h3>
                    <p class="padded-t"> Counselling and psychotherapy are both forms of cognitive therapy which use psychological methods to alleviate mental health issues.  These therapies are designed to help individuals alter behavioural patterns and improve coping skills. They are often used to treat mental health conditions, but can also be utilised for anyone wanting to make changes to their thoughts or behaviour. </p>
                    <p> This method of therapy can be used to treat multiple forms of conditions and disorders including depression, anxiety and PTSD. The aim of this form of therapy is to help people discover their own resilience, giving them the power to cope in a healthy way and gain a deeper understanding of themselves.</p>

                    <h3> Is therapy for me? </h3>
                    <p> People seek therapy for a range of different reasons at different points in their lives. reasons for seeking therapy vary greatly with each individual and could be due to a major life transition, those suffering unhelpful thoughts, or those simply wishing to improve their mental health. </p>
                    <p> The modern world has a significant amount of stressors which affect people in their everyday lives, and I truly believe any individual will gain immense value to their day-to-day life by investing in their mental health. Therapy is a collaborative approach designed to give the recipient a safe space to explore existing issues and treat them effectively. The most important factor is trusting your intuition and being open and honest during the process.  </p>
